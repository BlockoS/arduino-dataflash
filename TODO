1. Add support the rest of the AT45 family.
	Retrieve device density from status register on init
	ref: "Using Atmelâ€™s DataFlash" tab 4 & 5 p8
	     "DataFlash Binary Page Size"
 	We'd be able to deduce the default page size and bits :
	density : 512k, 1M, 2M, 4M, 8M, 16M, 32M, 64M
	page size : 264, 264, 264, 264, 264, 528, 528, 1056
	page bits : 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 10, 10, 11
2. Implement chip erase as multiple sector erases
3. Clean up and publish continuous write code
